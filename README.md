# Install Slack Dark Theme (Mac OSX Only)

This adds an event listener to the bottom of Slack that injects some CSS into the HEAD of the document.

# Instructions

After cloning this project and `cd`ing into its directory,

In your terminal:
```
./install.sh

Restart Slack.

You're going to have to re-run this every time Slack updates.


Cheers!
